main folder => Keeper-App folder

run 'npm install' in both client folder and in the main folder to add dependencies.

This react app is uploaded in development stage itself and not in production stage.

the database is hosted on the localhost so please run mongod before running the app.

in the main folder use 'npm run dev' to start both the app and server on same port of 3001.

Any suggestions to improve the app are welcome.
